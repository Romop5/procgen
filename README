ProcGen
================================

## About

*ProcGen* is a C++ library which can be used for procedural generation. It works as a blackbox that receives a description of generation, written down in **procedural language** at the input and outputs generated **collection of structures**.

The generation is similar to parametric L-systems, thus it has **rules** with **parameters**, which are **conditioned**. However, both rule body and condition are defined in **imperative manner**.

## Compilation 

The aim of this project is to be a CMake-complaint library. 

In order to compile the core of library, create a new directory `build` and run following command inside:
> cmake ../

Then use standard *make* pipeline.

> make

### Examples & Tests

Additionaly, you can compile examples and/or tests by specifing their presence *explicitly* in CMake command:

> cmake ../ -DBUILD_EXAMPLES  

or both:
> cmake ../ -DBUILD_EXAMPLES -DBUILD_TESTS

If tests are compiled, following command can be used to run them all:

> make test
