1. Add function parameters call control
2. add *= , += operators
3. Think of automated constructors for types

4. add sin/cos

=================
1. Clean the code
	- adding comments

2. Implement control-mechanism
	- add checks for return values

3. Possibly rewrite function / composite block defintion to
    - impossible atm
	- allow paralel condition evaluation in derivation system

4. Refactor
	- CMake system in order to create a properly make-able library
		which would be comfortable to work with 
	- See point #1 Clean code
6. Prepare examples
	- classic procedural techniques 
		- Cantor set fractal	- DONE

	- Incorporate library in real-world scenario
	- examples proposed by supervisor:
